# Crop_Diseas_Detection_System
This project aims to develop an automated solution to identify and classify crop diseases using images of leaves. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial pattern extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for tracking disease progression over time, the system will provide accurate and timely disease diagnoses.
